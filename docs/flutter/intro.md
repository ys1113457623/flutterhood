# What is Flutter

Flutter is an open source framework built on top of [Dart Language](/docs/flutter/what-is-dart.md) developed by Google launched in May 2017. It allows developers to build high-quality, natively compiled applications for mobile, web , desktop, smart TVs and Embeded devices(Raspberry Pi and Iot Devices).

## Analytics

![Analytics](./img/Flutter-Usage-Statistics.png)

- More than 36,889 projects were built with Flutter and have been downloaded over 11 Billion times.
- As of February 2023, Flutter has 487,428 repository results this number almost doubled as in 2022
- As of April 2023, Flutter has about [152K Stars](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) on Github and has about [159,751](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter) questions asked on Stackoverflow

## Whay it is growing so much ?

**1. Best for cross-platform app development.**

> Before Flutter, companies often chose cross-platform development for its cost-effectiveness and faster development time compared to native development, even though cross-platform apps typically lacked in performance and native appearance.
> However, with the introduction of Flutter, it became possible to build apps with performance that was close to native. This means that companies no longer have to choose between cost and quality when deciding on a development approach.

**2. Outstanding performance**

> Flutter apps achieve great performance results, ranging from 60 to 120 frames per second (fps), thanks to the use of Dart as its programming language. Dart is a client-optimized language that supports Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation. By running the code natively on each platform without relying on intermediaries, Flutter apps are faster than other cross-platform frameworks which use bridging technology.

**3. Hot Reload**

> Hot reload is a beloved feature among Flutter developers and highly valued by business owners. With hot reload, developers can instantly see the changes made to the code without the need to restart the application. This feature not only saves time but also reduces development costs.Hot reload enables developers to iterate quickly on code changes, identify and fix code errors more efficiently, and experiment more freely, leading to an improved user experience.

**4. Pre-built UI widgets**

> The core UI building blocks for Flutter apps are widgets. Flutter offers an extensive range of built-in widgets, including both stateless widgets such as Icon, IconButton, and Text, as well as stateful widgets like Checkbox, Radio, Slider, InkWell, and Form.

## Flutter Ecosytem

```
Why Did The Flutter Developer Cross The Road
To Get To The Flutter Plugin Store On The Other Side üòÇ
```
The Flutter ecosystem is a wonderful resource for developers, offering a wide range of tools and plugins to help them build better apps faster. So if you're a Flutter developer, don't be afraid to explore the ecosystem and discover all the great resources it has to offer!

For example, there are plugins for integrating with popular services like Firebase, Google Maps, and AdMob. There are also packages for integrating with popular state management solutions like MobX and Provide

In addition to the pre-built widgets and plugins, the Flutter ecosystem also includes a number of tools for testing and debugging your app. The Flutter team provides the Flutter DevTools, which is a suite of tools for analyzing and debugging Flutter apps. There are also a number of third-party testing frameworks and plugins available for Flutter, such as Flutter Driver and Flutter Test.

Finally, the Flutter ecosystem is supported by a large and active community of developers. This community is constantly developing new packages, plugins, and tools to improve the Flutter ecosystem and make app development easier and more efficient. This community is also a great resource for developers who are just starting out with Flutter, as there are many resources available for learning and getting started with the framework.
